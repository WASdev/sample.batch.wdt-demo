# sample.batch.wdt-demo

This sample makes use of the ***batch-1.0*** and ***batchManagement-1.0*** features of WebSphere Liberty. It is to be used when following the demo [Writing a Java batch application on Liberty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3AnK8JRR_U)

The demo walks through the minimal steps and configuration required to create and run a batch job with a Chunk step. A Chunk step includes mandatory Reader and Writer artifacts, and the example adds the optional Processor artifact.

**IMPORTANT:** For following the steps on the demo, you need to have Eclipse with WebSphere Application Server Developer Tools, and WebSphere Liberty installed, for installing them go [here](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/getstarted/).


## Steps to set up and use this sample app

**1.) Follow the steps on the [Writing a Java batch application on Liberty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3AnK8JRR_U) demo**
